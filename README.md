The main package used is chainer, it's similar to pytorch package.

You need to install these packages in your conda environment:

`pip install copy, numpy, pandas, chainer, matplotlib`

And make sure you have installed cudas and cudnn from nvidia (only for nvidia graphic cards) as well as an actual graphic driver.
Installation can be a bit tricky. 
Beware you need the right cudas version for a specific driver version. In my experience it can cause troubles if you install the newest driver version, that's why **I'm recommending to install the most stable, older version** like nvidia 490 and the corresponding cudas driver and cudnn package.

If you don't have an nvidia graphic card or can't seem to install cudas on your computer, just take the easy route and use GOOGLE COLABS.
